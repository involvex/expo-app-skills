## Releases

Development happens on feature branches, which are merged to `main`. Adventurous users who are tracking the `main` branch will receive these commits when they update their skills.

Most users track the `stable` branch. Repository maintainers publish releases by running `scripts/release`. This script fast-forwards `origin/stable` to sync it with `origin/main`.
